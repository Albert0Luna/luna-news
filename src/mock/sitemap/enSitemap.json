    "If you already know <a href='https://astro.build/' target='_blank'>Astro</a>, you'll know that it's a modern framework for building websites, designed to be fast, simple, and scalable.\n\nOne of the most outstanding features of <a href='https://astro.build/' target='_blank'>Astro</a> are the <a href='https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/' target='_blank'>\"islands\"</a>, a technology that it has popularized, allowing pages to be surprisingly fast thanks to their limited interactivity to certain areas.\n\nHowever, these traditional <a href='https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/' target='_blank'>\"islands\"</a> had a drawback: they loaded on the client. This worked well for static sites without a backend, such as blogs or portfolio pages, but it became complicated for sites that required dynamic backend content, such as e-commerce.\n\nThis is where Server Islands become an ingenious solution, maintaining the same concept of traditional <a href='https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/' target='_blank'>\"islands\"</a> but with the ability to process code from the backend.\n\n<div class='divisor'></div>\n\n## How do they work and when can I use them?\n\n<picture>\n\n<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dis6nw4o7/image/upload/v1722377769/190c148b-758c-4506-aefd-1c649a689a95.png' alt='Astro Server Islands Excalidraw' />\n\n<small>\n\nSource:\n<a href='https://astro.build/' target='_blank' >\n\nAstro\n\n</a>\n\n</small>\n\n</picture>\n\n<a href='https://astro.build/blog/astro-4120/#experimental-server-islands' target='_blank'>Server Islands</a> can process backend code on the server side. The great thing is that you can have multiple islands without having to wait for them to load for the content to render. Astro takes care of rendering them on the server and sending them to the client.\n\nIt's important to note that <a href='https://astro.build/blog/astro-4120/#experimental-server-islands' target='_blank'>Server Islands</a> are very useful for dynamic content that doesn't change frequently. For example, they may not be the best option for content that is constantly updated, such as a social network.\n\nCurrently, this feature is in beta, but you can try it experimentally in the <a href='https://astro.build/blog/astro-4120/' target='_blank'>Astro 4.12</a> version, which has not yet been officially released.",

However, <a href='https://astro.build/' target='_blank'>Astro</a>'s Server Islands are easier to implement and, in some benchmarks, have been shown to be faster than Next.js's PPR."
  ],
  "conclusion": "<div class='divisor'></div>\n\n## Conclusion\n\n<a href='https://astro.build/' target='_blank'>Astro</a>'s Server Islands are a very interesting feature that promises to revolutionize the way websites are built. They allow you to have a backend on a static site without sacrificing the speed and simplicity of <a href='https://astro.build/' target='_blank'>Astro</a>. Although this feature is still in experimental mode, it is something to keep in mind for the future of Astro and the creation of modern and fast websites.",

    "The Mac mini is a compact and versatile desktop computer that has been popular with Apple users for years, thanks to its minimalist design and good value for money, something uncommon in the Apple world. \n\nThe incorporation of an <a href='https://www.apple.com/mx/newsroom/2024/05/apple-introduces-m4-chip/' target='_blank'>M4 Chip</a> in the Mac mini would represent an attractive option for those looking for improved performance and greater energy efficiency. \n\nWith the <a href='https://www.apple.com/mx/newsroom/2024/05/apple-introduces-m4-chip/' target='_blank'>M4 chip</a>, Apple could offer a faster and smoother user experience, in addition to longer battery life.\n\n<div class='divisor'></div>\n\n## Why is there no Mac mini with M3?\n\nIt has been two years since the launch of the Mac mini with M2, and users have been eagerly awaiting an update. \n\nAlthough the <a href='https://www.apple.com/mx/mac-mini/' target='_blank'>Mac Mini with the M2</a> is still a solid option for many, the possibility of a Mac mini with an M3 chip seems increasingly distant. \n\nInstead, Apple's M4 chips are already a reality, suggesting that Apple may be skipping the M3 processor generation for some computers, especially the Mac mini.",

  "conclusion": "<div class='divisor'></div>\n\n## When is a Mac mini with M4 Expected?\n\nThe last Mac mini update was in January 2022, so it is expected that Apple will release an update to the Mac mini with M4 very soon.\n\nWhile there is no official release date yet, rumors suggest that Apple could announce the new Mac mini with M4 in late 2024.\n\n<div class='divisor'></div>",

    "## 1. Disable unnecessary extensions\n\n<picture>\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dis6nw4o7/image/upload/v1722131687/8270978d-d108-4824-8b4a-995587b572a9.png\" alt=\"Disable Visual Studio Code extensions\" />\n  <small>\n    Source: <a href=\"https://www.lunanews.tech/\" target=\"_blank\">Luna News</a>\n  </small>\n</picture>\n\nIt is very common for some Visual Studio Code extensions to consume many system resources, which can slow down the editor's performance. To improve the performance of Visual Studio Code, it is advisable to disable extensions that are not frequently used or that are not essential for the workflow. To disable an extension, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open Visual Studio Code.\n2. Click on the \"Extensions\" tab in the left sidebar.\n3. Search for the extension you want to disable.\n4. Click the gear button next to the extension and select \"Disable\".\n\n## 2. Update extensions and adjust the configuration\n\n<picture>\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dis6nw4o7/image/upload/v1723517796/1fef45cd-aae2-4fd6-b57c-6f5f94e01aa1.png\" alt=\"Update Visual Studio Code extensions\" />\n  <small>\n    Source: <a href=\"https://www.lunanews.tech/\" target=\"_blank\">Luna News</a>\n  </small>\n</picture>\n\nVisual Studio Code extensions are one of the reasons why it is so popular, but sometimes they can be the cause of the editor becoming slow.\nTo improve the performance of Visual Studio Code, it is important to keep extensions updated and adjust the configuration as needed.\n\nThis is because some Visual Studio Code errors can be caused by outdated extensions or incorrect configurations.\n\nTo update Visual Studio Code extensions, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open Visual Studio Code.\n2. Click on the \"Extensions\" tab in the left sidebar.\n3. Click the update button at the top of the extensions list.\n4. (Optional) You can select Auto-Update so that extensions are automatically updated.\n\n## 3. Clean the Visual Studio Code cache\n\n<picture>\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dis6nw4o7/image/upload/v1723485119/c1e33c9e-3188-4c13-8a6a-0095f2dc2a91.png\" />\n  <small>\n    Source: <a href=\"https://www.lunanews.tech/\" target=\"_blank\">Luna News</a>\n  </small>\n</picture>\n\nVisual Studio Code caches files and data to improve editor performance.\nHowever, sometimes the cache can grow too large and slow down the performance of Visual Studio Code.\n\nTo clean the Visual Studio Code cache, follow these steps:\n\n* **Locate the VS Code user data folder:** The location of this folder varies depending on your operating system:\n    * **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\\Code\\User\\` or `%USERPROFILE%\\.vscode\\`\n    * **macOS:** `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/`\n    * **Linux:** `$HOME/.config/Code/User/`\n* **Within the \"User\" folder, search for and delete the following folders:**\n    * `Cache`\n    * `CachedData`\n    * `Code Cache` (optional, this folder stores the cache of the VS Code main process)\n\n## 4. Switch to a light theme\n\n<picture>\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dis6nw4o7/image/upload/v1723485430/3b66efc1-feb9-44cd-bf1b-3150c5a25f5c.png\" alt=\"Change Visual Studio Code theme\" />\n  <small>\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com\" target=\"_blank\">Pexels</a>\n  </small>\n</picture>\n\nOne of the lesser-known reasons why Visual Studio Code might have poor performance is the theme you are using.\n\nDark themes are popular among developers, but they can consume more system resources than light themes.\n\nTo change the Visual Studio Code theme, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open Visual Studio Code.\n2. Enter `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the command palette or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS.\n3. Type \"Preferences: Color Theme\" and select the desired option (preferably the ones that come by default).\n\n## 5. Consider changing the SSD of your computer\n\n<picture>\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dis6nw4o7/image/upload/v1723518248/ssd_bc90bz.jpg\" alt=\"Man with an SSD\" />\n  <small>\n    Source: <a href=\"https://www.lunanews.tech/\" target=\"_blank\" >Luna News</a>\n  </small>\n</picture>\n\n\nIf your computer has a mechanical hard drive (HDD) instead of a solid-state drive (SSD), consider upgrading to an SSD to improve the overall performance of Visual Studio Code and your system in general. SSDs are considerably faster than HDDs and can significantly accelerate the speed of file loading and overall system responsiveness."

Nvidia and the Growth of the Video Game World\n\n<picture>\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dis6nw4o7/image/upload/v1723522499/nvidia-gaming-light_gwbwdm.jpg\" alt=\"Nvidia and joystick\" />\n  <small>\n    Source: <a href=\"https://www.lunanews.tech\" target=\"_blank\">Luna News</a>\n  </small>\n</picture>\n\nThe video game world has experienced exponential growth in recent years, and Nvidia has capitalized on this trend.\n\nSince the early days of modern gaming, it's been known that conventional processors weren't enough to run games optimally.\n\nCompanies like Nvidia seized the opportunity presented by these new processors known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit\" target=\"_blank\">GPUs</a>, and since then, Nvidia has been a leading player in the graphics card market.\n\n## 2. The Cryptocurrency Mining Fever\n\n<picture>\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dis6nw4o7/image/upload/v1723522681/crypto_fplqrx.jpg\" alt=\"cryptocurrencies\" />\n  <small>\n    Source: <a href=\"https://www.lunanews.tech\" target=\"_blank\">Luna News</a>\n  </small>\n</picture>\n\nCryptocurrency mining initially relied on conventional processors, but it was discovered that graphics cards were far more efficient for this task due to the parallel processing capabilities of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit\" target=\"_blank\">GPUs</a>.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2021, there was a cryptocurrency mining frenzy. During that time, obtaining a graphics card was nearly impossible, and waitlists for some models stretched for months.\n\nThis surge in demand led to skyrocketing graphics card prices. Graphics card companies benefited greatly, especially Nvidia. However, the event that would truly catapult Nvidia's stock and establish it as one of the world's most valuable companies was yet to come.\n\n## 3. The Artificial Intelligence Boom\n\n<picture>\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dis6nw4o7/image/upload/v1723522901/ia-nvidialight_emr4gq.jpg\" alt=\"Nvidia and Artificial Intelligence\" />\n  <small>\n    Source: <a href=\"https://www.lunanews.tech\" target=\"_blank\">Luna News</a>\n  </small>\n</picture>\n\nIt's no secret that artificial intelligence is here to stay, and contrary to popular belief, it's not a new concept but rather one with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence\" target=\"_blank\">decades of development</a> behind it.\n\nHowever, once again, conventional processors proved insufficient for running artificial intelligence algorithms optimally. Processes like neural network training or embedding require massive computational power.\n\nThis is where Nvidia enters the scene once more with its GPUs. As we know, these are much more efficient at parallel processing, making them ideal for artificial intelligence tasks.\n\nNvidia has seized the opportunity presented by the AI boom and capitalized on it effectively, even shifting its market strategy to focus more on artificial intelligence. They've gone so far as to rebrand themselves from a graphics card company to an artificial intelligence company."
